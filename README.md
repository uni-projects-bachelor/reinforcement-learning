# Reinforcement Learning

This repository implements reinforcement learning algorithms for AI agents, focusing on decision-making strategies in game environments.

## Features:
- **Value Iteration (VI)**: A dynamic programming algorithm for computing the optimal policy and value function.
- **Policy Iteration (PI)**: Another dynamic programming method for computing the optimal policy through iterative policy evaluation and improvement.
- **Q-learning**: A popular model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the value of actions.

For more details, please refer to the provided documentation.
